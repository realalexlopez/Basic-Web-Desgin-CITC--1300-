        <h1 class="heading_style">The Delorean-Time-Machine</h1>
        <p>The time machine in Back to the Future is built using a DeLorean DMC-12, a car that was originally produced by the DeLorean Motor Company in the early 1980s. The car was known for its distinctive stainless steel body and gull-wing doors. Although the car itself was not a commercial success, its futuristic look made it the perfect choice for a time machine.</p>

        <h3> the DeLorean, Time Machine features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flux Capacitor: The iconic flux capacitor, invented by Doc Brown, was the key element that made time travel possible. This device was designed and built by the film's special effects team. It was mounted inside the car and powered by the "fluxing" energy at 88 miles per hour. The flux capacitorâ€™s design became one of the most memorable elements of the movie.</li>
            <li>Powering the DeLorean: Originally, Doc Brown used 1.21 gigawatts of power to make the car time-travel ready. In the movie, this power comes from a flux capacitor and later from a lightning bolt. To make the car actually "move" in time, a nuclear reaction or lightning strike is required</li>
            <li>Details & Effects: The glowing lights, wires, and spark effects were all part of a carefully orchestrated design to give the car a sci-fi, cutting-edge look. The effects team used various techniques to make the time travel appear magical, from sparks flying off the DeLorean to flames shooting out of the back as it accelerated into time.</li>
